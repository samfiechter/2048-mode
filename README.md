2048-game.el
============

An emacs mode to play Gabriele Cirulli's 2048
---------------------------------------------

I thought I'd post this -- it's an attempt to write Gabriele Cirulli's to emacs lisp.

Just eval in emacs and run the function 2048-game...
Up, Down, Left and right move the board 
q and n quit the game and reset the board respectively.
